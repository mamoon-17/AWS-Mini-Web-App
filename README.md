## Deployment Architecture

This app uses several AWS services to provide a production-like environment:

* **Amazon S3** – Hosts the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as a static site
* **Amazon EC2** – Runs the Flask backend, handles HTTP requests and connects to the database
* **Amazon RDS** – Hosts a managed PostgreSQL database containing movie data

Security groups are configured to:

* Allow traffic between EC2 and RDS
* Expose EC2’s API port for client access
* Enable S3 frontend to call the EC2 API via CORS

---

## Data Source

* Movie data inspired by **Marvel** and **DC Comics** superhero franchises
* IMDb scores and metadata referenced from public movie databases
